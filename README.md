=======

atraman stands for athletics training manager. 
It is an app which shall allow athletes to log an plan their training sessions.

development notes:

The app will be written with the kivy framework for python and maybe some sqlalchemy for the server.

The main language of the app will be german, but maybe there will be also an english version, 
if the interest in it is high enough.
